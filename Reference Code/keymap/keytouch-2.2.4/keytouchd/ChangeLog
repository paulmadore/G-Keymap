Version 2.2.2:
 - Comparing keycode with VOLUMEUP or VOLUMEDOWN for determining auto-repeat mode is
   now done with strcasecmp() instead of strcmp().
 - Xsession script is now called 92keytouchd_launch.
Version 2.2.1:
 - Fixed line in Xsession script
Version 2.1.4:
 - The active keyboard grab is canceled before executing a plugin or program (the grab
   is normally canceled when the grabbed extra function key is released). This makes
   it possible that plugins can simulate key presses using XFakeKeyEvent().
Version 2.1.0:
 - Auto repeat mode is turned on for keys with keycode VOLUMEUP and VOLUMEDOWN.
Version 2.1.0 beta:
 - Added signal handlers so that the program can be killed in a nice way.
 - Fixed memory leak.
