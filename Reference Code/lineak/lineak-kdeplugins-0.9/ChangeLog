   Fixed two bugs which stopped the SETURL macro from working.

   Many bug fixes have gone into the KDE plugins. Also, I've just added a
   KONQUEROR_RELOAD_ALL_TABS macro to reload all of the tabs in a window.

   This package has been updated to work with the latest KDE (3.2).
   Specifically, the konqueror plugin no longer relies on kxmlrpc, and can 
   now find the active instance of konqueror. It also respects the new plugin
   interface from lineakd 0.8beta3, where it was changed to support modifiers.
