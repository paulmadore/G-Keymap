This is a KDE GUI for configuring lineakd. KlineakConfig can create/modify a users
lineak config file, as well as create/modify a custom keyboard definition file.

KlineakConfig has a dialog to allow you to define your own keyboard and easy
access keys by entering the name of the key, and then pushing the key right after.
You can view, modify and delete the key mappings to your hearts delight. It does limit
itself to attempting to grab something that really is an easy access key, but this is
a best guess. 

KlineakConfig has a separate dialog for configuring keys. It supports toggleable and
normal keys as well as allows you to select from all of the supported macros and allows
you to assign arguments to those macros. The new dialog also allows you to set a display
name for all keys.

Version 0.9.0-pre1 will only work with lineakd version 0.9.0-pre1 or higher. It is important that you
have the most recent version of lineakd installed as klineakconfig uses new api's that are only
available in 0.9.0-pre1 or later.

It is important that lineakd is within your path. The configure script will
search for lineakd as a means to find the lineakkb.def definition file for all
of the keyboards. If it does not find it it will fail. It is also important that you
do not run lineakd as a standalone process anymore (well you can still but the
handling of it if you run klineakconfig is not very graceful).

Below is the line that I used to configure KLineakConfig. YMMV

./configure --build=i386-linux --host=i386-linux --target=i386-linux --prefix=/usr/local --disable-debug

If you have any problems compling this or wish to note a bug send a description
