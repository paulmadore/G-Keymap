Better KDE integration.

Make a user defined keyboard the default.

The program does not track the picture for a user defined keyboard if the program is restarted. It should pick it up in the main dialog, but will not contribute it.

In the future...
	possibly make into a kcontrol module.
    possibly make into a KDE service started in the background on login.
    add arts support to lineakd
