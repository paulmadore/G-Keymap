The installation of lineaksetup is managed by Apache Ant.

To install lineaksetup, you must have a Java JRE of version 1.4 or higher.  It is possible to compile the program using gcj (see instructions below), but at this time, you MUST have a Java JRE installed in order to run the program.  You must also have the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) installed.

Once these requirements are met, compile via the following command:

    ant -Dswt=[Location of swt.jar]

If you wish to use gcj for the purpose of compilation, compile with the command:

    ant -Dswt=[Location of swt.jar] -Dcompiler=gcj

To install the program, use the command:

    ant install

To install to a location other than the default (/usr/local), execute:

    ant install -Dprefix=[Where to install to]

To uninstall, execute:

    ant uninstall

To clean up the source directory, execute:

    ant clean


Because I like examples, I would install lineaksetup in the following manner:

    ant -Dswt=/usr/share/swt-3/lib/swt.jar
    su
    ant install
