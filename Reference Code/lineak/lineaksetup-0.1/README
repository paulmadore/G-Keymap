lineaksetup - v0.1

Thanks for downloading lineaksetup!

lineaksetup is an application written in Java SWT to automate the process
of creating a LinEAK configuration file.  I hope that it eases your time
and that you will find it useful.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

Lineak and related plugins should be installed before you use this application.

Java JRE Version 1.4 or above.  The application has been tested both with Sun Java
and Blackdown Java: both work.  You may compile the program with gcj, but you will
require a JRE in order to actually run it.

http://java.sun.com/
http://www.blackdown.org/

SWT Version 3 or above.  The application was written using SWT 3, it has not been
tested with any lower version.

http://www.eclipse.org/swt/

Apache Ant Version 1.6.5 or above.  All testing has been performed with Ant 1.6.5,
the application has not been tested with any lower version.  Apache Ant is a
compilation-management tool (similar to make) that is geared for Java.

Gtk+ Version 2.6.8 or above.  This is in fact an SWT dependency, but you will
therefore need it to run the application.  Gtk is a widget library that SWT
builds as in Linux.  It is EXTREMELY likely that you already have this
installed if you use any sort of graphical environment, but it can't hurt to
check.

That about does it.  I hope that you find this application useful!
